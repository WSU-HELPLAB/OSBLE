<h1>Creating a Review Assignment</h1>
<p>
    This tutorial demonstrates how to create a critical review assignment in OSBLE.
    Note that this tutorial assumes that you have already completed the steps outlined in the
    &quot;@Html.ActionLink("Creating a Basic Assignment", "CreateBasicAssignment")&quot; tutorial.
    To begin, navigate to the &quot;Assignments&quot; tab.
    <br /> Once there, click on the &quot;Create New Assignment&quot; link.
</p>
<img src="@Url.Content("~/Content/images/help/basic_1.png")" alt="click the create new assignment link" />
<hr width="90%" />
<p>
    To reach this location on the <b>mobile</b> version of the site, simply open the main menu and select &quot;Assignments&quot;.
</p>
<img src="@Url.Content("~/Content/images/help/basic_mobile_1.png")" alt="navigate to the users tab on mobile" />
<hr width="90%" />
<p>
    <br /> At the assignment type selection page, we will select the critical review radio button and click the &quot;Begin&quot; button.
</p>
<img src="@Url.Content("~/Content/images/help/review_1.png")" alt="click on critical review" />
<p>
    <br /> We are next brought to the component selection page.  Critical review assignments can be team based and can include both student and 
    instructor rubrics.  
    For simplicity, we will not select any of these options.  Click the &quot;Continue&quot; button to advance to the next screen.
</p>
<img src="@Url.Content("~/Content/images/help/review_2.png")" alt="do not select any components" />
<p>
    <br /> The &quot;Basic Settings&quot; page for critical reviews is exactly the same as it is for @Html.ActionLink("basic assignments", "CreateBasicAssignment").  
    Use this page to specify the assignment's name, description, due date, and late submission options:
</p>
<img src="@Url.Content("~/Content/images/help/review_3.png")" alt="fill out basic settings" />
<p>
    <br /> Clicking the &quot;Next&quot; button will load the &quot;Link Previous Assignment&quot; tab.  In a previous tutorial, we created a basic 
    assignment entitled &quot;Assignment 1&quot;. We now select that assignment from the dropdown list and click the &quot;Next&quot; button.
</p>
<img src="@Url.Content("~/Content/images/help/review_4.png")" alt="choose sample assignment" />
<p>
    <br /> The final tab allows the instructor to set up the review teams.  In the example pictured below, we have 
    two reviewers and two authors.  Notice that the boxes for both authors have red backgrounds.  
    This indicates that neither author has submitted a deliverable for the assignment under review.  
    As these are assignments are created as an example, this is to be expected and we will ignore the warning.  
    However, in an actual class, we might use this information to not assign any students these authors.  
    Furthermore, a more typical course will contain many more reviewers and authors.  
    To assist in creating review teams, OSBIDE has the functionality to automatically create teams for all 
    authors that have checkboxes next to their names.  OSBIDE also supports anonymous critical reviews, 
    which can also be specified on this page.<br /><br />
    In the example below, we have Christian reviewing Sean and Sean reviewing Christian.  
    Note that OSBLE does allow authors to participate on review teams, so we could potentially 
    have both Christian and Sean reviewing Christian's work.  When satisfied with the review settings, click the &quot;Next&quot; button.
</p>

<p>
    <br /> Clicking the &quot;Next&quot; button brings us to the final screen of the assignment creation wizard.  
    From here, we can go back and edit the assignment's details, publish the assignment, or return to the main assignment page.
