# Adding Courses in OSBLE+
In order to submit assignments using the OSBLE{"+"} Visual Studio Plugin, you must be registered for the relevant course.  To do so, you may visit the [OSBLE+ website](http://plus.osble.org) in your web browser or click the "View OSBLE{"+"} in your browser" icon in the toolbar menu  

If you do not have an OSBLE{"+"}  account you'll need to create an account first. Click "Sign Up" on the OSBLE{"+"}  home page.
