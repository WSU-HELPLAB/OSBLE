# Basic OSBLE{"+"} VS Plugin Usage

If the OSBLE{"+"} VS Plugin toolbar did not automatically appear, it can be opened manually by right-clicking on empty space in the toolbar area and selecting "OSBLE{"+"} Toolbar."

## Log in Action
Clicking the "log in" button brings up the same login window found underneath the "Tools" menu.  When you are logged into the OSBLE{"+"} VS Plugin, the background changes from inactive ![](Basic OSBLE+ VS Plugin Usage_basic4.png) to active (yellow background) ![](Basic OSBLE+ VS Plugin Usage_basic5.png).  As long as you are logged into OSBIDE, you have access to the other OSBIDE components.  

## Activity Feed Action
Information about the activity feed is on its own [Activity Feed](Activity-Feed) page.

## Profile Action
Information about user profiles is on its own [User Profile](User-Profile) page.

## Help Action
Clicking on the help button will bring up the [OSBLE+ VS Plugin documentation.](https://osble.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=VS%20Plugin)

## Web Browser Action
Some users may prefer to view the OSBLE{"+"} activity feed in a web browser as opposed to within Visual Studio.  To open the OSBLE{"+"} activity feed for the web, click the web browser icon.  This will launch OSBLE{"+"} in your default web browser.
