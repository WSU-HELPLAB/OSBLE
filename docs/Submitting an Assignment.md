This will open the submit assignment window.  From here, select the specific course and assignment that relates to your currently open project.  Note that if you cannot find your course from the course dropdown, you will need to make sure you are registered on [OSBLE+](http://plus.osble.org) and the instructor has added you to the course you want to submit the assignment to. For more information on adding a course, see the [course search](course-search) documentation page.
