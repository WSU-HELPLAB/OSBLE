! Welcome to OSBLE+
OSBLE{"+"} uses a modified version of [url:OSBIDE|http://osbide.codeplex.com] which is an open-source plugin for Visual Studio that aims to increase the understanding of how interactions within an IDE are related to academic performance.  OSBIDE has been developed by members of the Human-centered Environments for Learning and Programming (HELP) Lab (http://helplab.org) in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Washington State University. The HELP Lab is directed by Dr. Chris Hundhausen. As teachers and researchers, the developers of OSBLE/OSBLE{"+"} care about your privacy. Accordingly, we have established the privacy policy outlined below.

!! What data does the OSBLE{"+"} VS Plugin store?
The OSBLE{"+"} VS Plugin tracks your IDE usage and reports that information back to OSBLE+â€™s servers.  Actions that are reported include (but are not limited to) file saves, project builds, runtime exceptions encountered, debugging attempts, and errors generated.  Additionally, OSBLE{"+"} will store the name and student ID number that you provide during setup.
